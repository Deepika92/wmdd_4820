# library app due midnight Nov 29(the day before our last class)

start with the code in the week11 folder and work from there.

add functionality to the library app, try to make an actual useful app that
would allow a user to look at the books in a library, borrow books from a
library...

create at least one user that can 'take out' a book, add at least 2 of the 
below options + some functionality that you come up with. 

1) the ability to create a new user(give someone a library card)

2) come up with a way to keep track of the books, maybe use a boolean for available
or have multiple copies and allow a user to borrow a book as long as the number
of copies is greater than zero

3) create a due date for books and keep that information attached to the
borrowers account

4) book reservation, if a book is out allow someone to reserve a copy.

5) search for a book by book title, or genre.

try to keep your code D.R.Y(do not repeat yourself).  
use comments.  
be clean and consistent, organize your code logically.  
make it your own, change the css, add images... whatever seems appropriate to
you!
